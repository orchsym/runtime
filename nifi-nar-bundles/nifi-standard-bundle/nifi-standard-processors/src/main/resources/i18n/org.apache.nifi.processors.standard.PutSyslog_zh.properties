__CapabilityDescription=Sends Syslog messages to a given host and port over TCP or UDP. Messages are constructed from the "Message ___" properties of the processor which can use expression language to generate messages from incoming FlowFiles. The properties are used to construct messages of the form\: (<PRIORITY>)(VERSION )(TIMESTAMP) (HOSTNAME) (BODY) where version is optional.  The constructed messages are checked against regular expressions for RFC5424 and RFC3164 formatted messages. The timestamp can be an RFC5424 timestamp with a format of "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH\:mm\:ss.SZ" or "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH\:mm\:ss.S+hh\:mm", or it can be an RFC3164 timestamp with a format of "MMM d HH\:mm\:ss". If a message is constructed that does not form a valid Syslog message according to the above description, then it is routed to the invalid relationship. Valid messages are sent to the Syslog server and successes are routed to the success relationship, failures routed to the failure relationship.
__Tags=syslog, put, udp, tcp, logs
Hostname.displayName=Hostname
Hostname.description=The ip address or hostname of the Syslog server. Note that Expression language is not evaluated per FlowFile.
Protocol.displayName=Protocol
Protocol.description=The protocol for Syslog communication.
__AllowableValue.Protocol.TCP.displayName=TCP
__AllowableValue.Protocol.UDP.displayName=UDP
Port.displayName=Port
Port.description=The port for Syslog communication. Note that Expression language is not evaluated per FlowFile.
Max_Size_of_Socket_Send_Buffer.displayName=Max Size of Socket Send Buffer
Max_Size_of_Socket_Send_Buffer.description=The maximum size of the socket send buffer that should be used. This is a suggestion to the Operating System to indicate how big the socket buffer should be. If this value is set too low, the buffer may fill up before the data can be read, and incoming data will be dropped. Note that Expression language is not evaluated per FlowFile.
SSL_Context_Service.displayName=SSL Context Service
SSL_Context_Service.description=The Controller Service to use in order to obtain an SSL Context. If this property is set, syslog messages will be sent over a secure connection.
Idle_Connection_Expiration.displayName=Idle Connection Expiration
Idle_Connection_Expiration.description=The amount of time a connection should be held open without being used before closing the connection. Note that Expression language is not evaluated per FlowFile.
Timeout.displayName=Timeout
Timeout.description=The timeout for connecting to and communicating with the syslog server. Does not apply to UDP. Note that Expression language is not evaluated per FlowFile.
Batch_Size.displayName=\u5206\u6279\u6570\u91cf
Batch_Size.description=The number of incoming FlowFiles to process in a single execution of this processor. Note that Expression language is not evaluated per FlowFile.
Character_Set.displayName=\u5b57\u7b26\u7f16\u7801
Character_Set.description=\u6307\u5b9aSyslog\u6d88\u606f\u7684\u5b57\u7b26\u96c6\u7f16\u7801
Message_Priority.displayName=Message Priority
Message_Priority.description=The priority for the Syslog messages, excluding < >.
Message_Version.displayName=Message Version
Message_Version.description=The version for the Syslog messages.
Message_Timestamp.displayName=Message Timestamp
Message_Timestamp.description=The timestamp for the Syslog messages. The timestamp can be an RFC5424 timestamp with a format of "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH\:mm\:ss.SZ" or "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH\:mm\:ss.S+hh\:mm", " or it can be an RFC3164 timestamp with a format of "MMM d HH\:mm\:ss".
Message_Hostname.displayName=Message Hostname
Message_Hostname.description=The hostname for the Syslog messages.
Message_Body.displayName=Message Body
Message_Body.description=The body for the Syslog messages.
__Relationship.success.description=FlowFiles that are sent successfully to Syslog are sent out this relationship.
__Relationship.failure.description=FlowFiles that failed to send to Syslog are sent out this relationship.
__Relationship.invalid.description=FlowFiles that do not form a valid Syslog message are sent out this relationship.
